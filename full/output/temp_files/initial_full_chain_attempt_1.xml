    <verification_notes>While multiple meetings are documented, finding a single photograph or video encompassing both individuals might require extensive searching across different news archives and official Vatican sources.  This link is Tier 2 because, while widely reported, verifying a specific visual is challenging without significantly more dedicated search efforts.  Fortification attempts to find a Tier 1 source proved difficult due to the formal nature of the meetings and the stringent access protocols.</verification_notes>
