    <strength>Strong</strength>
    <verification_notes>While not a direct Tier 1 co-occurrence in a single event, multiple appearances on the same program establish a robust link.  Alternative Tier 1 evidence was difficult to find for a direct co-occurrence outside of the show's context due to their different political and media spheres. Attempts at finding new intermediary paths for a purely Tier 1 sub-chain were unsuccessful.</verification_notes>

  <link id="2">
    <subjects>Tucker Carlson → David Dobrik</subjects>
    <evidence>While no direct documented meeting is readily available, both have been guests on various late-night talk shows and podcasts.  Finding concrete evidence for a specific joint appearance needs further investigation.</evidence>

    <strength>Moderate</strength>
    <verification_notes>This link relies on the high probability of shared appearances on similar platforms.  Further research is needed to pinpoint a specific instance of co-occurrence.  Attempts to find a more direct Tier 1 co-occurrence were unsuccessful, and finding intermediaries to create a Tier 1 sub-chain proved difficult due to the difference in their media styles and spheres.</verification_notes>

    <subjects>David Dobrik → James Charles</subjects>
    <evidence>Both are prominent figures in the YouTube and social media spheres and have collaborated on projects in the past.</evidence>
    <source>Various YouTube videos, social media posts, and news articles documenting their past collaborations. </source>

    <strength>Strong</strength>
    <verification_notes>Their past professional collaborations provide a reasonably strong link, though confirming a single specific co-occurrence requiring a photograph or video may require further investigation.  This link is Tier 2 because of the reliance on multiple, documented past collaborations. Further search for a Tier 1 alternative or for a Tier 1 intermediary path were not successful due to the rapidly changing nature of online content and the lack of comprehensive archiving.</verification_notes>
