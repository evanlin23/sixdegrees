    <subjects>Eleanor Roosevelt → Jackie Kennedy Onassis</subjects>
    <evidence>Both were prominent figures in American society and attended numerous social and political events.  While a specific joint event is hard to pinpoint with Tier 1 evidence, their overlapping circles and shared social milieu strongly suggest numerous opportunities for documented co-occurrence at events covered by press photography.</evidence>
    <source>Multiple biographies of both Eleanor Roosevelt and Jackie Kennedy Onassis mention their overlapping social circles and participation in similar events. Extensive historical archives exist for both figures.</source>

    <strength>Moderate</strength>
    <verification_notes>Direct Tier 1 evidence of a specific joint event is elusive.  The strength of this link relies on the high likelihood of shared events given their prominent roles and overlapping social circles.  Extensive searches failed to find a concrete Tier 1 event, so alternative intermediary paths were explored and deemed too unreliable at this time. Further research may reveal a suitable Tier 1 event. </verification_notes>

    <subjects>Jackie Kennedy Onassis → RuPaul</subjects>
    <evidence>While no direct co-occurrence is readily documented, both were subjects of significant media attention, and it's highly probable they were mentioned in the same publications or news segments given the cultural impact of both figures.</evidence>
    <source>Extensive media coverage of both Jackie Kennedy Onassis and RuPaul across various decades.</source>

    <strength>Weak</strength>
    <verification_notes>This link is weak due to lack of direct documented co-occurrence. Tier 1 evidence of a shared event is elusive. It relies on the presumption of shared media presence due to their respective cultural impacts and lasting legacies, but lacks a robust source confirming this shared exposure.</verification_notes>
