  <link id="1">
    <subjects>Sean Hannity → Mark Levin</subjects>
    <evidence>Both Sean Hannity and Mark Levin have appeared as guests on numerous conservative talk shows and podcasts, often discussing similar political issues.  While not always together on the same show at the same time, their frequent appearances on similar platforms strongly suggest a shared professional sphere and the possibility of encountering each other at industry events.</evidence>

    <strength>Moderate</strength>
    <verification_notes>While direct photographic evidence of them together is difficult to locate immediately, their extensive overlap in professional circles and frequent appearances on similar venues makes a co-occurrence plausible. Tier 1 evidence is elusive due to lack of readily available documentation of specific events they've attended together.  Efforts to find alternative Tier 1 or stronger Tier 2 links failed.</verification_notes>

    <subjects>Mark Levin → Steven Crowder</subjects>
    <evidence>Both Mark Levin and Steven Crowder are prominent figures in the conservative media landscape, frequently appearing on similar shows and podcasts.  They share overlapping guests and discuss related political topics.  While not always appearing together, their close association within the conservative media ecosystem suggests the possibility of shared events.</evidence>

    <verification_notes>Similar to the previous link, direct photographic evidence is challenging to find immediately.  Their association within a common professional space makes co-occurrence plausible but lack of readily available documentation makes a Tier 1 connection challenging. Efforts to find alternative Tier 1 or stronger Tier 2 links failed.</verification_notes>

  <link id="3">
    <subjects>Steven Crowder → James Charles</subjects>
    <evidence>Both Steven Crowder and James Charles are known for their significant online presence and often participate in online discussions or debates that occasionally involve similar subjects. Although their viewpoints often differ sharply and a direct co-occurrence is unlikely, the possibility that they may have both participated in large-scale online events or industry functions with a broad range of participants cannot be excluded completely.</evidence>
    <source>Analysis of their respective online activities and public appearances. No direct documentation of a shared event is readily available.</source>

    <context>Shared participation in large-scale online events or industry functions is a remote possibility.</context>
    <date_range>2015-Present</date_range>
    <strength>Weak</strength>
    <verification_notes>This link represents a significant challenge.  The extremely low probability of a documented co-occurrence necessitates a Tier 3 classification. Attempts to find an alternative intermediary to create a more robust Tier 1 or Tier 2 link to James Charles from Steven Crowder proved unsuccessful given the substantial differences in their professional circles and content.</verification_notes>
