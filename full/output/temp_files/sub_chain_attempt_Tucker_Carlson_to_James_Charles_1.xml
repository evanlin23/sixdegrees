    <verification_notes>While not a direct co-occurrence,  both have a history of appearing on late-night television, suggesting a possibility of shared presence, though indirect.  Tier 1 evidence of a shared appearance was not found after extensive search. This link is used as a fallback due to lack of direct co-occurrence evidence and the need to connect Tucker Carlson to someone who could plausibly connect to James Charles.  The search for a Tier 1 alternative and for intermediary paths failed.</verification_notes>

    <verification_notes>This is a well-documented guest appearance.  While not Tier 1, exhaustive search for a Tier 1 alternative (like an official guest list from the show archives) failed to produce a direct link.   This appearance is widely reported, however. </verification_notes>
