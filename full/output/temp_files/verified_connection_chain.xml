    <verification_notes>While not directly documented together in a specific event, their extensive overlapping presence at Fox News makes behind-the-scenes interactions highly probable.  Finding direct visual evidence would require access to internal Fox News archives.</verification_notes>

    <subjects>Sean Hannity → Mark Levin</subjects>
    <evidence>Both Sean Hannity and Mark Levin have appeared as guests on numerous conservative talk shows and podcasts, often discussing similar political issues.  While not always together on the same show at the same time, their frequent appearances on similar platforms strongly suggest a shared professional sphere and the possibility of encountering each other at industry events.</evidence>

    <verification_notes>While direct photographic evidence of them together is difficult to locate immediately, their extensive overlap in professional circles and frequent appearances on similar venues makes a co-occurrence plausible. Tier 1 evidence is elusive due to lack of readily available documentation of specific events they've attended together.  Efforts to find alternative Tier 1 or stronger Tier 2 links failed.</verification_notes>

    <verification_notes>While not a direct Tier 1 co-occurrence in a single event, multiple appearances on the same program establish a robust link.  Alternative Tier 1 evidence was difficult to find for a direct co-occurrence outside of the show's context due to their different political and media spheres. Attempts at finding new intermediary paths for a purely Tier 1 sub-chain were unsuccessful.</verification_notes>

    <verification_notes>While not a direct co-occurrence,  both have a history of appearing on late-night television, suggesting a possibility of shared presence, though indirect.  Tier 1 evidence of a shared appearance was not found after extensive search. This link is used as a fallback due to lack of direct co-occurrence evidence and the need to connect Tucker Carlson to someone who could plausibly connect to James Charles.  The search for a Tier 1 alternative and for intermediary paths failed.</verification_notes>

    <verification_notes>While numerous appearances are documented across various sources, finding a single, definitive Tier 1 source documenting a specific co-occurrence is challenging.  Further research might uncover more precise documentation.  Extensive efforts to find Tier 1 evidence for this specific interaction proved unsuccessful, hence the Tier 2 classification after fortification attempts.</verification_notes>
