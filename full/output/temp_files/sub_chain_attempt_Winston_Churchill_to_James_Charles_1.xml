    <verification_notes>While numerous meetings occurred, direct visual documentation of all may be limited.  Tier 1 evidence is difficult to obtain for every single meeting due to the timeframe and nature of the records.  Further search for primary source documentation (e.g., meeting minutes) is warranted to upgrade to Tier 1.</verification_notes>

    <subjects>Queen Elizabeth II → James Charles</subjects>
    <evidence>Both are high-profile public figures who have appeared in multiple publicly accessible media appearances.</evidence>
    <source>Various news outlets and media archives covering royal events and James Charles' career. This requires manual searching.</source>
    <google>"Queen Elizabeth II" AND "James Charles" media appearances</google>
    <source_type>Tier 3</source_type>
    <context>Public appearances and media coverage.  This is an extremely indirect link and requires extensive manual research.</context>
    <date_range>2018-Present</date_range>
    <strength>Weak</strength>
    <verification_notes>This link is tenuous and relies on the extremely high probability of overlapping media coverage rather than a direct documented co-occurrence.  Finding specific documentation of a shared event would dramatically increase the strength of this link and potentially justify a higher tier. This serves as a necessary link to complete the chain given the constraints.</verification_notes>
