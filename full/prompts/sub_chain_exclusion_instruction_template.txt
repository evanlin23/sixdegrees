You are tasked with finding a NEW sub-chain of connections between {last_verified_person_name} and {target_person_name}.
Please adhere to the following critical instructions:

1. DO NOT suggest '{immediate_next_step_to_avoid}' as the immediate next person connected from '{last_verified_person_name}'. This specific connection has just failed verification. You must find an alternative.
{avoid_intermediaries_instruction}
{previously_failed_direct_links_instruction}
4. Your primary goal is to find a *new* and *valid* path from '{last_verified_person_name}' to '{target_person_name}', even if it requires multiple intermediate steps.
5. If you cannot find any valid new sub-chain under these constraints, respond with <research_failure reason="Cannot find a new sub-chain from {last_verified_person_name} to {target_person_name} avoiding previous failures."/>.
