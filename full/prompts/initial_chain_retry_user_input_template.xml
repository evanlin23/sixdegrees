  <person1>{person1_name}</person1>
  <person2>{person2_name}</person2>
  <previous_attempt_feedback>
    Your previous attempt to generate a connection chain between {person1_name} and {person2_name} resulted in a research failure or malformed XML.
    Previous response snippet (if available): {previous_response_snippet}
    
    Please re-attempt to find a connection chain.
    Consider the following strategies:
    1. Explore a DIFFERENT set of initial intermediaries if the previous path seemed like a dead end.
    2. Be more expansive in your search for co-occurrences.
    3. Ensure your response strictly adheres to the required <connection_chain> XML format, including all sub-elements as defined in the original system prompt.
    4. Do NOT output a <research_failure> tag unless all possible avenues, including very long and indirect chains, have been truly exhausted according to the Unwavering Persistence Protocol.
    
    Your entire response MUST be a valid <connection_chain> XML document.
