    Focus on finding individuals with documented co-occurrences with {current_person_name} and providing complete `connection_details`.
    The `ranking_score` should reflect the suggested intermediary's general popularity, "connectedness", or likelihood of being a social "hub". Do not consider the overall search's ultimate target for this ranking.
    The verifiability of the link between {current_person_name} and the suggested intermediary is most important.
